My name is Tolani and I have a best friend called Ruth we
are both 300L students of federal university. oye Ekiti state
same faculty of management science but different
department, ! am in accounting department while Ruth was
in Banking and finance we are both intelligent
We are roommates.
Ruth is a book worm, she doesn't party all she knows how
to do best is to attend campus fellowship, I'm the contrary
I'm the clubbing type, and I drink alcohol but the fact about
me which no one believes is that I'm still a virgin at 23..
Some weeks ago our students went on a peaceful protest
which cost us the lost of some students and for this reason
the school was shut indefinitely.. Ruth traveled to her
parents house in Lagos while I remain in school as I don't
feel like going home
On a Saturday I decided to clean our room up in the
process I found Ruth's diary, opening to read I read the
most shocking things nobody knows about Ruth, Ruth was
a bad girl I thought I'm bad until I read Ruth's diary... can't
enjoy her diary alone let's read together.
